# The-math-game
This is my first game with python, it will have a screen in newer versions but right now it's just raw code in cmd or IDLE (depends how you open it)

The software is free to use and you can modify it and distribute modified (just please don't steal it and say it's yours)
The game is in polish but I'm going to make english version when i have time

That's all, you can comment what do you want me to do with it and what to add.
